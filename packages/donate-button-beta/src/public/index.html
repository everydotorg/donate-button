        - It's easy — Manage all your giving in one place, get one tax receipt at the end of the year, and never forget about a recurring donation. In fact, you can pause and cancel those with one click.

        - It's privacy-first — You don’t have to share your contact information with a nonprofit in order to support them.

        - It's secure — Your donation transactions are secured through Stripe and Plaid, industry leaders in online payments processing. No need to worry about unstandardized payments.

        - You can maximize your impact — If you donate with your bank account, 100% of processing fees are covered.

        - It helps nonprofits reach more people — People are more likely to support nonprofits that other people support. When you give on Every.org and share your activity with your community, you're effectively supporting your nonprofit twice with the ripple effect of giving.

        ## How does making a donation on Every.org work?
        Every.org is a US 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We are here to make your charitable giving easy and joyful. Once you sign up for Every.org, you can see the nonprofits others in your community support, and make donations to support those and other nonprofits.

        Each donation you make goes to Every.org first and we immediately issue a receipt for your charitable contribution, then make a disbursement to the nonprofit you recommended.

        We aggregate donations from all of our donors and make disbursements periodically. If the nonprofit connected their bank account with us, they can request payouts at any time and cadence. Otherwise, we disburse to nonprofits in partnership with Network for Good, another 501(c)(3) nonprofit. On a monthly basis, Network for Good issues lump-sum grants to selected nonprofits.

        This process ensures your eligibility for a tax-deduction and consolidated records of your giving, and reduces the administrative burden of the nonprofits to process multiple small donations from hundreds of donors.

        ## How long does it take for my donation to reach the nonprofit?
        If the nonprofit has connected with us, they will see your donation in their Admin Dashboard immediately and will be able to request a payout to get the money in their bank account within a few days, or automatically get paid out weekly on Mondays.

        Otherwise, it can take around 1~8 weeks for the donation to reach the nonprofit. At the end of each month, we batch the donations and send them to our disbursement partner, Network for Good, who sends the payments on the 15th of the following month. The donation will reach the nonprofit faster if they have direct deposit set up with Network for Good.

        If you have a contact at the nonprofit, you can let them know to connect their bank account so that donations reach them faster.

        We have selected a wide variety of nonprofits to make it easy for generous souls like you to support your favorite causes. Using the Site, you can make gifts of support to all (or nearly all) of the nonprofits listed.

        When you make a gift of support to a Nonprofit through the Site, your Donation goes directly to Every.org first, which has exclusive legal control over the Donation, and we issue you a receipt for your charitable contribution as a US 501(c)(3) nonprofit. At the time you make a Donation to Every.org, you also tell us which Nonprofit you’re hoping to support with that Donation. On a regular basis, Every.org approves your recommendation and disburses funds collected through Donations to recipient Nonprofits (either directly, or through a third-party nonprofit partner). We strive to ensure that your Donation goes to the Nonprofit that you preferred for your gift of support. This process ensures your eligibility for a tax-deduction and consolidated records of your giving, and reduces the administrative burden of the Nonprofits to process multiple small donations from hundreds of donors.

        If circumstances make Giver to that particular Nonprofit impossible or inappropriate (such as if the selected Nonprofit ceases operations or loses its tax-exempt status), we will attempt to contact you first for additional preferences on where you would like your Donation to go. If we do not receive your preferences before we must disburse the funds, then we may in our sole discretion select an alternate Nonprofit to receive the Donation. We will do our best to direct your Donation to a Nonprofit in a similar space and/or with similar goals. Except in cases of fraud, we do not issue refunds.

        When you Donate through the Site, you may do so by either making a Recurring Donation or by making a One-Time Donation. You must provide a valid payment method to make a Donation using the Site. By providing your Payment Provider information, you agree that Every.org (through its third party payment service providers) is authorized to charge your Payment Provider for the full amount of any Donations you agree to make using the Site and that no additional notice or consent is required for such charges. You agree to notify us of any change in your billing address or payment account information used for payment hereunder.

        If you would like to cancel a Recurring Donation, you may do so at any time by updating your settings on the Site. If the details of your Recurring Donation change, for example if we remove a nonprofit from our system, we will notify you and obtain your instructions prior to charging your next Recurring Donation payment.`,
